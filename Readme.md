# Bootstrap Laravel with Vagrant

Get started developing a Laravel project with all the goodies and conveniences of
modern development.

Will get you going with a fresh stable Laravel project, bower, grunt with live reload and asset
management using SASS, bootstrap 3, Jeff's generators and all on Vagrant!

The only dependencies are Vagrant and Git (I think...).

# Get Started

Download and Install Vagrant

`http://www.vagrantup.com/`

Clone this project as your own

`git clone git@github:michael-bender/laravel-vagrant-bootstrap.git MyProject`

Start Up Vagrant

    cd MyProject
    vagrant up // This may take a while the first time

Serve your App

`grunt serve`
